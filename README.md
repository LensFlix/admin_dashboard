# LensFlix Admin Dashboard 

Lensflix Dapp is a decentralized application (dapp) that allows users to upload content to their Lens profiles using UDL licensing on the Arweave blockchain. This project was developed during a hackathon and showcases the use of various technologies.

## Technologies Used

- **UI:** We built the user interface using React and Chakra UI to create a sleek and user-friendly design.

- **Blockchain Integration:** The dapp connects to users' Metamask wallets through Moralis and ethers, enabling seamless interaction with the Ethereum blockchain.

- **Lens API:** We utilized Lens' GraphQL API to obtain access tokens and post content to users' Lens profiles.

- **Decentralized Storage:** Content is securely stored on the Arweave network using Bundlr, ensuring durability and immutability.

- **Content Licensing:** The dapp employs UDL (User-Defined Licenses) for content licensing, giving users control over how their content is used.

- **State Management:** We utilized Redux for efficient state management, enhancing the app's performance and responsiveness.

- **Rapid Development:** To expedite development, we incorporated web3uikit, which provides pre-built components and design patterns tailored for blockchain applications.

- **Deployment:** The dapp is deployed using Vercel, making it easily accessible to users.
